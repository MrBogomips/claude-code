# Harness setup — build and maintain the agent team

This skill builds and maintains a project-local **agentic harness**: a team of agent
definitions, the skills those agents use, an orchestrator that coordinates them, and a
pointer in the project's `CLAUDE.md`. It writes files. It does not do the project's domain
work — it builds the agents and skills that do.

Read the model first: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/shared/harness-model.md` defines the three
parts (agent = who, skill = how, orchestrator = when/order) and why they stay separate.

## This skill vs harness-review

`harness-setup` is the **writer** — every change to the harness goes through it. `harness-review`
is the **reader** — it assesses an existing harness and writes nothing. When a request is
"assess / review / audit / how well is it used," that is `harness-review`. When a request
creates or changes anything, it is this skill. After `harness-review` hands off a *review
context*, this skill is what acts on it.

## Step 0: Orient before writing

Always check the current state first, then pick the path. Do not start generating until the
plan is confirmed.

1. **Take the user's starting context, if any.** This skill accepts an optional context at
   the start — domain notes, constraints, tools already in use, or a review context from
   `harness-review`. Read it and fold it into everything below.
2. Read `.claude/agents/`, `.claude/skills/`, and the harness section of `CLAUDE.md`.
3. Branch on what you find:
   - **New build** — no harness, or empty agent/skill dirs → run Steps 1–7 in full.
   - **Extend** — a harness exists and the request adds or changes an agent or skill → run
     only the needed steps, per the extension matrix in `references/maintenance.md`.
   - **Apply a review context** — `harness-review` produced a prioritized list → work it as
     an interactive improvement pass (see `references/maintenance.md`).
   - **Sync** — the files and the `CLAUDE.md` record disagree → reconcile and record the
     correction.
4. Present the plan and confirm it before generating. Tool research and tool maintenance are
   part of a good harness, so make them part of the plan you present **every run** — don't
   wait to be asked:
   - **Always ask whether to run tool discovery** (Step 1b), on a new build or an extension.
   - **On an existing harness** (extend / apply-review-context / sync), **also ask whether to
     run a tool-maintenance review** of the registered `tools.md` (see
     `references/maintenance.md`).
   Record the answers. Asking is the default; a "no" is a fine answer, but a silent skip is
   not. Running happens only on a yes — see Step 1b. This confirms the approach; the concrete
   list of files and tools is approved separately at Step 2b, before anything is written.
5. **Account for the project's spec process.** A harness is the *who/how/when* of the work; a
   spec-driven development (SDD) system is the *project process* the work follows. They are
   complementary, so check which case applies — scan with
   `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/shared/detection-signatures.md`:
   - **No SDD system, project looks like software** → offer to run the `spec-advisor` skill, which
     advises which SDD system fits and delegates setup to that system's own installer. Offering is
     the default; running is gated on a yes, and nothing is installed without `spec-advisor`'s own
     per-system approval. If the user installs one, fold its coordination into the plan below.
   - **An SDD system is present** → do not re-recommend and do not install. Identify the system and
     version, look up its row in `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/shared/sdd-coordination.md`, and record a
     **coordination context** — `{system, version, owned-segment, activation, auto-invokable,
     hand-back contract, write-back rule}` — to carry into Step 2 and Step 5. This is the lightweight
     read `harness-setup` needs to bake the coordination into the orchestrator; `spec-advisor` still
     owns recommending and installing.

   Record the answer either way.

## Step 1: Analyze the domain

1. Identify the domain and the core task types (creation, validation, editing, analysis).
2. Explore the codebase — tech stack, data models, key modules — so agents and skills fit
   the project rather than a generic template.
3. Check for conflicts or overlap with any existing agents and skills from Step 0.
4. Read the user's technical level from the conversation and match your wording to it.
   Explain a term like "assertion" or "schema" when the cues suggest it is unfamiliar.

## Step 1b: Discover tools — always offered, run on acceptance

Step 0 always offers tool research as part of the plan; run this step when the user accepts.
It can also be triggered on its own later, against an existing harness. Offering is the
default; running is gated on that yes — and adopting any individual candidate is gated on a
separate, explicit per-tool yes (Step 3). Those two gates are the safeguard: the user is
always asked, and nothing is installed behind their back.

This skill proposes nothing of its own — the candidates come from a live search, not a
built-in catalog:

1. Hand a **search-optimized subagent** (`general-purpose`, with web search) a tight context
   — the project's domain, stack, and task types from Step 1 — and have it find candidate
   MCP servers and plugins that fit. Also inspect the local and session configuration for
   tools already available, so you don't propose what is already there.
2. Present each candidate with the **role** it would fill, what it does, and its trade-off.
   The user **accepts or rejects each one explicitly**. Adopt only what is accepted.
3. Accepted tools become install/register rows in the Step 2b manifest; once that is
   approved, register them **by role** in the tools registry under the orchestrator — a
   `tools.md` file in `.claude/skills/{domain}-orchestrator/references/`. It is a lookup of
   role → preferred tool → alternative (for when the preferred one is unavailable) → status.
   Agents and skills reference a tool by its **role**, never by a hard tool name, so the
   harness falls back to the alternative when a tool is missing.

The subagent's context template, the acceptance flow, and the registry schema are in
`references/tool-discovery.md`. Registered tools are reviewed periodically — see
`references/maintenance.md`.

## Step 2: Choose the execution mode and the architecture pattern

**Execution mode.** Default to an **agent team** when two or more agents genuinely need to
exchange information mid-task; fall back to **subagents** when they do not, or when the
experimental team tools are unavailable. The team-tools caveat and the mechanical fallback
mapping are in `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/shared/execution-modes.md` — read it and decide the
mode before designing the team, because the mode shapes the agent definitions and the
orchestrator.

**Architecture pattern.** Decompose the work into areas of expertise and pick a structure.
The six patterns — Pipeline, Fan-out/Fan-in, Expert Pool, Producer-Reviewer, Supervisor,
Hierarchical Delegation — with their fit and their team-mode suitability are in
`references/agent-design-patterns.md`. Composite patterns are common; the same reference
covers them.

**Split agents** along four axes — expertise, parallelism, context, reusability. The
criteria table is in `references/agent-design-patterns.md`. Prefer a few focused agents over
many thin ones; coordination cost grows with team size.

**Coordinate with the spec process.** If Step 0 recorded a coordination context (an SDD system is
present), decide *with the user* how the orchestrator and the SDD compose — they must work together
without overlap and with minimal friction, not run in parallel. Using
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/shared/sdd-coordination.md`, settle: which phases the orchestrator **delegates**
to the SDD (the spec/plan/decompose segment it owns) versus **owns** (typically execution,
integration, and a cross-boundary QA pass); and whether activation is **auto-invokable** (the
orchestrator calls the SDD's CLI/MCP entry point with a contextual prompt) or **human-gated** (it
emits the prompt and pauses for the user, as with an IDE or an approval step). Fold the decision into
the Step 2b manifest so it is approved before any write.

## Step 2b: Approve the change manifest — required before any write

Before creating, updating, or deleting anything — and before installing or uninstalling any
tool — present a single explicit **change manifest** and get the user's formal approval. This
is mandatory on every path: new build, extend, apply-review-context, sync. Nothing is written
to `.claude/` or `CLAUDE.md`, and no tool is installed or removed, until the user approves it.

This is not the Step 0 plan confirmation. Step 0 agrees the approach before the design exists;
the manifest is the concrete, itemized list of exactly what this run will touch, produced once
the design is settled. Writes and installs change the user's repository and environment and are
awkward to undo — one explicit sign-off on the exact list is what keeps the run from making a
change the user did not expect.

Present it as concrete items, each labelled with its action and target:

| Action | Target |
|--------|--------|
| create / update / remove | `.claude/agents/{name}.md` (one row per agent) |
| create / update / remove | `.claude/skills/{name}/` (one row per skill) |
| create / update | `.claude/skills/{domain}-orchestrator/` |
| update | `CLAUDE.md` (harness pointer + change-history row) |
| install / uninstall | `{role} -> {tool}` (only if tool discovery or maintenance proposed it) |

List only the rows that apply. If the user amends the list — drops an agent, declines a tool,
renames a skill — revise and present it again; the approval is of the final list. Once
approved, carry out exactly what was approved in Steps 3–6 — no extra files, no extra installs.

## Step 3: Generate the agent definitions

Write every agent as a file under `.claude/agents/{name}.md` — including agents that use a
built-in type (`general-purpose`, `Explore`, `Plan`). Put the built-in type in the spawn
call; put the role, principles, and protocol in the file. The reason is in the harness
model: a role defined only inline is not reusable next session and carries no collaboration
contract.

Each agent file states: core role, working principles, input/output protocol, error
handling, and collaboration. In team mode, add a **team communication protocol** section —
who it messages, who messages it, and what it claims from the shared task list. The
definition template and worked agent files are in `references/agent-design-patterns.md` and
`references/team-examples.md`.

**Model.** Default each agent to `model: inherit` so it follows the session's model. A
harness's quality tracks its agents' reasoning, so for a role that depends on judgment rather
than throughput, pin the strongest reasoning model explicitly — by its current dated id (e.g.
`claude-opus-4-8`), not a bare `opus` alias that ages.

**If the team includes a QA agent.** Use the `general-purpose` type (`Explore` is read-only
and cannot run validation). Make its core method *cross-boundary comparison* — read both
sides of a contract together (the producer and the consumer), not each in isolation — and
run it incrementally as each module lands, not once at the end. The full methodology,
boundary-bug patterns, and a QA agent template are in the `qa-agent-guide` reference under
the `harness-review` skill.

## Step 4: Create the skills

Create each skill the agents use at `.claude/skills/{name}/SKILL.md`. The authoring guide —
description writing, body principles, progressive disclosure, data-schema standards — is in
`references/skill-writing-guide.md`. The essentials:

- **Description.** It is the only trigger mechanism. Write it to be specific about what the
  skill does and when it should fire, slightly pushy to offset conservative triggering, and
  worded to stay clear of skills that should *not* fire on the same request.
- **Body.** Explain the *why* rather than issuing bare "ALWAYS/NEVER" rules — an agent that
  understands the reason handles edge cases correctly. Keep it lean (aim under 500 lines;
  move detail to `references/`). Generalize to the principle instead of overfitting to one
  example. Write imperatively.
- **Progressive disclosure.** Metadata is always in context; the body loads on trigger;
  `references/` load only when needed. Split large or domain-specific detail into
  `references/` so only the relevant file loads.
- **Linking.** One agent uses one or more skills; a skill may be shared across agents. The
  skill holds *how*; the agent holds *who*.

## Step 5: Build the orchestrator and register the pointer

The orchestrator is a skill whose subject is the team: which agents take part, what each
produces, how outputs flow, and how failures are handled. Templates for team, subagent, and
hybrid modes — with data-passing, error handling, and test scenarios — are in
`references/orchestrator-template.md`.

Build into the orchestrator:

- **A context-check first phase** so it distinguishes an initial run from a follow-up or a
  partial re-run (branch on whether `_agents_workspace/` already exists).
- **Follow-up trigger keywords** in its description ("re-run", "update", "modify",
  "supplement", "improve the previous result", and everyday domain phrasings). Without
  these, the harness goes unused after its first run.
- **Data-passing** stated explicitly, matched to the mode — see
  `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/shared/execution-modes.md`.
- **Error handling** that does not assume success: retry once, then proceed without the
  missing result and note the omission; never delete conflicting data — record it with its
  source.
- **The tools registry**, when tool discovery (Step 1b) has run: it lives in this
  orchestrator's `references/` directory as `tools.md`, and agents and skills reference tools
  by role from it.
- **SDD coordination**, when Step 0 recorded a coordination context: splice the addenda from
  `references/orchestrator-template.md` (SDD coordination section) into the orchestrator's phase 0,
  prepare, and integrate phases, **inlining the system's concrete artifact paths and entry point** —
  the orchestrator cannot read the shared file at runtime. Mark each phase as delegated
  (`→ SDD: {system}`) or orchestrator-owned. The model is in
  `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/shared/sdd-coordination.md`.

When extending rather than building new, modify the existing orchestrator — do not create a
second one. Reflect a new agent in the team composition, task assignment, data flow, and
trigger keywords.

Then **register the pointer** in the project's `CLAUDE.md`: goal, trigger rule, and the
change-history table — and nothing the file system already holds. The convention and the
template are in `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/shared/claude-md-pointer.md`.

## Step 6: Record the change in history

Every write to the harness appends a row to the change-history table in `CLAUDE.md`
(`Date | Change | Target | Reason`). This is a required step, not optional — it is how
evolution stays visible and regressions stay catchable. The table format is in
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/shared/claude-md-pointer.md`.

## Step 7: Capture feedback

A harness is a system that keeps changing, not a one-time artifact. After a run, offer the
user the chance to feed back ("anything to improve in the result, the team, or the
workflow?"). If there is none, move on — do not force it. When there is, route it to the
right place: output quality → the relevant skill; missing role → a new agent definition;
wrong order → the orchestrator; missing trigger → a description. The routing table and the
evolution triggers (recurring feedback, repeated failures, the user bypassing the
orchestrator) are in `references/maintenance.md`.

## Deliverable checklist

Before calling a setup or change complete:

- [ ] The full change manifest (agents / skills / orchestrator / pointer / tools to create /
      update / remove / install / uninstall) was formally approved before any write.
- [ ] Every agent is a file under `.claude/agents/` — including built-in types.
- [ ] Skills exist under `.claude/skills/` with valid `name` + `description` frontmatter.
- [ ] One orchestrator, with data flow, error handling, and test scenarios.
- [ ] Execution mode is stated (team / subagent / hybrid; per-phase if hybrid), with the
      subagent fallback covered when team mode is the default.
- [ ] Each agent's model is set deliberately (`inherit` by default; a pinned dated model id only where judgment needs it).
- [ ] No `commands/` directory was generated.
- [ ] No conflict with existing agents or skills.
- [ ] Skill and orchestrator descriptions are pushy and include follow-up keywords.
- [ ] Each SKILL.md body is within ~500 lines; overflow moved to `references/`.
- [ ] The orchestrator's first phase does a context check (initial / follow-up / partial).
- [ ] If an SDD system is present: the orchestrator activates it via a contextual prompt and resumes
      on hand-back, every phase has exactly one owner, and no SDD artifact is copied into
      `_agents_workspace/`.
- [ ] The `CLAUDE.md` pointer is registered (goal + trigger + change history; plus the spec-process
      line when an SDD system is present).
- [ ] The change-history table records this change.
- [ ] The user was asked whether to run tool research (and, on an existing harness, tool
      maintenance), and the answer was recorded — whatever they chose.
- [ ] If tool discovery ran: nothing was adopted without explicit approval, and accepted
      tools are registered by role (with alternatives) in the orchestrator's `tools.md`.
