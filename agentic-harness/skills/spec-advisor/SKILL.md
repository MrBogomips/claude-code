# Spec advisor — choose and set up a spec-driven development system

When a software project has no spec-driven development (SDD) system, this skill helps the user
**choose** a fitting one and **delegates setup to that system's own installer**. It never authors
specs, PRDs, or ADRs — the installed system owns its workflow. The skill advises; it writes
nothing of its own except by running the chosen system's installer, and only after explicit
approval.

It is offline-first. Everything needed to scan, recommend, and name an install command is in the
two curated references; the network is reached only with the user's say-so (see the online policy
in `references/spec-systems.md`).

## What this skill is not — and which skill to use instead

The "no duplication" boundary is the point of this skill, so it is worth stating as hard limits.
This skill does **not**:

| Does NOT | Use instead |
|---|---|
| Author specs, PRDs, or ADRs | the **installed system** — it owns its workflow |
| Build the `.claude/` agent harness (agents, skills, orchestrator) | **harness-setup** |
| Assess how well a harness is used | **harness-review** |
| Create Claude Code components (skills, agents, plugins) | **plugin-dev / skill-creator** |
| Give one-shot Claude Code automation recommendations | **claude-code-setup** |
| Push a spec system when one is already present | nothing — the scan reports and stops |
| Write to `CLAUDE.md` | nothing — the chosen system's on-disk artifacts are self-evident |

A spec system is a *project process*, not a role-tool that agents call — so it is also kept out
of the harness `tools.md` registry. If the request is to build or change the agent harness, that
is `harness-setup`; if it is to assess one, that is `harness-review`. This skill is only about
the project's spec/planning process.

## The flow

Run these in order. Each gate is an off-ramp: the skill is advisory, not coercive, so a "no"
anywhere ends the run cleanly.

### Step 0 — Scope check: is this a software project?

SDD systems are for building software. Confirm the project is software before going further —
look for a manifest or source: `package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `go.mod`, `Cargo.toml`,
`pom.xml`, a `*.csproj`, `Gemfile`, and the like. If the project is not software (docs, content,
data, ops config with no codebase), explain briefly that an SDD system is not the right tool and
**stop**. Recommending one here would be pushing a process the project has no use for.

### Step 1 — Scan first: is a spec system already present?

Using `references/detection-signatures.md`, scan for any existing spec system **or** ADR registry.
**If one is found, report what is present and where, then stop.** Do not push a second system on
top of one already in use — an existing process is the user's decision, and stacking a second SDD
system creates exactly the duplication this skill exists to avoid. This is a read-only report; the
scan writes nothing. The disambiguation rules (the shared `requirements/design/tasks` triple
resolved by parent directory; BMAD v4 vs v6; ADR signals) are in that reference — apply them
before concluding.

### Step 2 — Opt-in gate: offer a recommendation

If no system is found, offer to recommend one. This is the opt-in gate: a "no" ends the run
cleanly. Offering is the default; nothing past this point happens without the user's yes.

### Step 3 — Profile for fit

A good recommendation depends on the project's shape, so gather a few quick signals — by asking,
or by inferring from what Step 0 already saw:

- **Greenfield or brownfield** — a fresh repo tolerates a heavier pipeline; an existing codebase
  usually wants lighter, change-scoped specs.
- **Solo or team** — team workflows benefit from approval steps and named roles; a solo dev
  rarely wants the ceremony.
- **Process appetite** — anywhere from lightweight decision records (ADRs) to a full agile
  pipeline with personas.
- **Agent or IDE already in use** — an IDE/AWS commitment points one way (Kiro); a Claude
  Code-centric flow points another.

### Step 4 — Recommend (offline)

From the curated shortlist and the **selection decision tree** in `references/spec-systems.md`,
present **2–3 best-fit candidates** with rationale — not a single verdict. Before finalizing,
**offer** the opt-in discovery search (a broad "is there anything newer than the shortlist?" web
search); run it **only on an explicit yes**, and if it stalls or the environment is offline, fall
back silently to the curated data. Then the **user picks one explicitly**. Do not choose on their
behalf.

### Step 5 — Delegate setup

For the selected system:

1. **Optionally fetch current setup details** from that system's **official repository** (the URL
   in its profile) — install command and docs. This is the authoritative fetch (online form b),
   a precise pull from the canonical source, not a broad search. Skip it offline and use the
   curated install command.
2. **Present the install command and get explicit approval before executing it.** An install is
   an exec-and-write — it changes the user's repo and environment — so it is gated exactly like
   harness-setup's change manifest. State the command, what it will create, and where.
3. **Run or guide the system's own installer.** Then **confirm what was created and where**.
4. **Never author specs.** Once the system is installed, its own workflow takes over. The skill's
   job ends at a working, confirmed install.

**IDE special case — AWS Kiro.** Kiro is an IDE, not a repo package. A skill cannot install an
IDE into a repository, so for Kiro this is **detect-and-advise only**: explain what it is, point
the user at the official source (kiro.dev), and stop. Do not run an installer or hand-scaffold
`.kiro/`. The Kiro caveat in `references/spec-systems.md` has the detail.

## Error handling and graceful degradation

- **Offline, or a search stalls** — fall back to the curated data; never block on the network. The
  offline path is complete on its own.
- **Detection ambiguity** — resolve the shared `requirements/design/tasks` triple by parent
  directory first (per `references/detection-signatures.md`); if still ambiguous, report exactly
  what was found and ask, rather than guessing the system.
- **Installer failure** — report the failure and point the user at the system's official
  troubleshooting source. Do not partially hand-roll the setup; a half-installed system is worse
  than a clean failure the user can retry.
- **User declines at any gate** — stop cleanly. The skill is advisory; an off-ramp taken is a
  valid outcome, not a failure.

  table and the disambiguation rules (triple-by-parent-dir, BMAD v4/v6, ADR signals).
