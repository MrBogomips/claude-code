# Harness review — assess an existing harness (read-only)

This skill diagnoses an existing agentic harness and produces a *review context*: a
prioritized account of what works well and what to improve. It is the **reader** half of the
plugin — it writes nothing. The fixes it identifies are carried out by `harness-setup`.

The harness model it assesses against is in `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/shared/harness-model.md`
(agent = who, skill = how, orchestrator = when/order).

## This skill vs harness-setup

`harness-review` reads and judges; `harness-setup` writes. A request to "review / assess /
audit a harness" or "how well is the harness used" is this skill. A request that creates or
changes anything is `harness-setup`. The output here is a review context that hands off to
`harness-setup` — this skill never applies a change itself.

## The read-only contract

Make no edits — not to `.claude/agents/`, not to `.claude/skills/`, not to `CLAUDE.md`, not
to project memory. Run nothing that mutates the project. When a fix is obvious, write it into
the review context as a recommendation for `harness-setup`; do not apply it. The value of a
reader is that its findings are trustworthy precisely because it changed nothing.

This contract is also backed mechanically: the skill sets `disallowed-tools: Write, Edit,
NotebookEdit`, so those tools are removed from the pool while it runs. `Bash` stays available
for read-only inventory — the prose above still governs it; run nothing that mutates the project.

## Step 1: Inventory the harness

1. List `.claude/agents/` and `.claude/skills/`; identify the orchestrator skill.
2. For each agent, read its frontmatter and role; for each skill, read its name and
   description. Note the declared execution mode.
3. Map which skills each agent uses and how the orchestrator wires them together.

## Step 2: Read the record

Read the harness section of `CLAUDE.md` — the goal, the entry-point directive (the hard gate
routing every prompt through the orchestrator), and the change-history table. The convention is
in `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/shared/claude-md-pointer.md`. The history tells you how the harness has
evolved and where recent changes concentrated.

## Step 3: Detect drift

Compare three views of the harness:

- the files in `.claude/agents/` and `.claude/skills/`,
- the orchestrator's stated composition,
- the `CLAUDE.md` pointer and change history.

List every discrepancy: an agent or skill present in the files but absent from the record or
the orchestrator; something the record names that no longer exists; an orchestrator that
references a member it never forms. Do not reconcile drift — report it. Reconciliation is a
write, and belongs to `harness-setup`.

**Tracker-sync drift** — when the harness includes a generated `tracker-sync` skill (a
`.tracker-sync/` store at the repo root; model in
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/shared/tracker-sync-protocol.md`), read its state read-only and judge
each signal against the sync config (the `mapping.md` under the generated skill):

- **Cursor age vs the configured cadence** — a cursor far older than the cadence means the
  sync is not running.
- **Unresolved conflict count** in `conflicts.md` — a growing log nobody reads is drift in
  the projection.
- **Open-proposal backlog age** in `proposals.md` — an old `open` proposal means a human
  state decision is waiting for adoption while state push stays suspended for that item.
- **Orphan counts** (`orphaned-remote` / `orphaned-local` in `map.jsonl`) — terminal states
  pending a user decision that nobody has made.
- **A stale `reports/` directory** — a schedule is registered but not producing reports
  (or producing only "role unavailable" reports, which points at headless auth).

Each is a finding for `harness-setup` — including "the sync exists but shows no sign of
running at all".

## Step 4: Assess effective usage

Drift tells you what *exists*; usage tells you what is *used*. Judge effective usage from a
fixed, deterministic signal set — read each, infer nothing you cannot ground in one:

- **Project auto-memory** at `~/.claude/projects/<project-hash>/memory/` — what the project
  has recorded about how work actually happens.
- **The `CLAUDE.md` pointer and change history** — whether the entry-point directive is present
  and current (a soft "use the skill for X" trigger instead of the hard gate is itself a finding),
  and what has been changing.
- **The `.claude/` inventory** — what the harness offers.
- **The tools registry**, if present (a `tools.md` in the orchestrator's `references/`
  directory) — which roles are filled by which tools, and their alternatives.

From these, classify each skill and agent as **used**, **unused**, **bypassed** (the work
happens but around the harness), or **drifted** (present but out of sync). When the orchestrator
itself is bypassed — work in its domain happening without it — treat the entry-point directive as
the first suspect: flag it for `harness-setup` to strengthen (hard gate in `CLAUDE.md`, plus an
entry-point description), not just the skill's keywords. Apply the same lens
to registered tools: is each one still used, and is there now a better alternative for its
role? Flag tools that look unnecessary or superseded — as findings for `harness-setup`, not
changes you make. If there is no tools registry at all, treat that as a finding too —
recommend that `harness-setup` offer tool research — since a harness with no considered
tooling is more often an oversight than a decision. The method for reading each signal and
making the call is in `references/usage-assessment.md`. This step is strictly read-only.

## Step 5: Validate

- **Structural.** Agents are files in the right place (including built-in types); skill
  frontmatter has `name` and `description`; cross-references between agents are consistent;
  no `commands/` directory was generated.
- **Triggering.** For each skill description, write should-trigger and should-NOT-trigger
  queries — the should-NOT set built from near-misses, including ones that belong to a
  *different* skill. Confirm the descriptions separate cleanly and don't collide. The method
  is in `references/skill-testing-guide.md`.
- **Effectiveness.** Where feasible, compare the deliverable with the skill against the same
  task without it, to confirm the skill adds value. Also in `references/skill-testing-guide.md`.
- **Dry-run.** Walk the orchestrator: is the phase order logical, do data-passing paths have
  no dead links, does each phase's input match the previous phase's output, is each error
  fallback executable? Check the declared execution mode against
  `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/shared/execution-modes.md` — in particular, that a team-mode
  harness has the subagent fallback it needs.
- **QA agent, if present.** Check it against the QA methodology — does it compare across
  boundaries rather than only confirm existence, and run incrementally rather than once at
  the end? See `references/qa-agent-guide.md`.

## Step 6: Emit the review context

Produce a prioritized review context — the deliverable of this skill — and hand it to
`harness-setup`:

````markdown
## Harness review: {domain} — {date}

### Works well (keep)
- {finding} — {brief evidence}

### To improve (act on)
| Priority | Finding | Target | Why |
|----------|---------|--------|-----|
| high | {what's wrong} | {agent / skill / orchestrator / CLAUDE.md} | {evidence and impact} |
| medium | ... | ... | ... |

### Drift
- {discrepancy between files, orchestrator, and record}

### Suggested next step
Hand this context to `harness-setup` to act on the "to improve" items in priority order.
````

Order the "to improve" items by impact, name a concrete target for each (so `harness-setup`
knows where the fix lands), and ground each in evidence from the steps above — not in
speculation. Keep "works well" honest: it tells `harness-setup` what not to touch.
