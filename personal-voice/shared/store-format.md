# Voice store format

The single definition of where the voice profile lives, what each file holds,
how entries are written, and where each observation or rule goes. The write,
learn and maintain skills all follow this file.

## Stores

| Store | Location | Holds |
|---|---|---|
| Global | The directory set in the plugin's `store_dir` option. The skill that sent you here gives you the path | The author's tone, lexicon and exemplars. Personal to the author |
| Project | `.personal-voice/` at the project root: the git top-level directory, or the working directory outside git | Project material only: client and project terms, document-type conventions |

If the global path is empty, or still reads as a placeholder that starts with
`${`, the store is not configured: tell the user to set **Voice store
directory** in `/config` (or when enabling the plugin) and write nothing.

The global store never lives inside the plugin's installation or data
directory. Uninstalling the plugin leaves it in place.

## Layout

```
<global store>/
├── core.md                  tone for every language and topic
├── languages/<code>.md      tone for one language, cross-topic expressions
├── topics/<slug>.md         lexicon for one topic
├── exemplars/<slug>.<code>.<nn>.md   texts the author wrote without AI
└── observations.md          pending observations; last maintenance date

<project root>/.personal-voice/
├── glossary.md              client and project terms
├── content-types/<slug>.md  conventions for this project's document types
└── observations.md          pending project observations
```

Create a file or folder only when the first entry for it is written. Recording
an observation creates `observations.md` at most; a rule file is created when
maintenance promotes its first rule.

## Naming and language

- **Language codes**: ISO 639-1, lowercase (`en`, `it`, `de`).
- **Topic slugs**: kebab-case English nouns (`software-engineering`, `cycling`,
  `family`). Reuse an existing slug before creating a new one.
- **Dates**: `YYYY-MM-DD`.
- **Store language**: frontmatter, headings and rule text are in English.
  Quoted expressions and exemplars stay verbatim in their original language,
  inside double quotes.

## Files

Every file starts with a small YAML frontmatter. Rules are the `- ` bullets
under the headings listed for the file; each bullet is one rule.

### `core.md`

```markdown
---
kind: core
---
## Tone
## Audiences
## Avoid
## Expressions
```

`Tone`: register, rhythm, sentence length, punctuation habits that hold in
every language. `Expressions`: words or phrases the author uses in every
language and topic (rare). `Audiences`: tone for a specific audience. `Avoid`: LLM habits
the author removes in any language (stock openers, rule-of-three lists, forced
contrasts, closing summaries).

### `languages/<code>.md`

```markdown
---
kind: language
language: it
---
## Tone
## Audiences
## Avoid
## Signature expressions
```

`Tone` and `Audiences`: punctuation, register and address forms for this
language. `Avoid`: LLM habits typical of this language. `Signature
expressions`: words and phrases the author uses across topics in this language.

### `topics/<slug>.md`

```markdown
---
kind: topic
topic: software-engineering
personal: false
description: Professional texts about building and running software
---
## Glossary
## Preferred expressions
## Borrowed expressions
```

`Glossary`: the topic's most used terms and the author's choice among
synonyms. `Preferred expressions`: technical and jargon phrasing. `Borrowed
expressions`: expressions from other languages the author uses as a quirk or
identity. `personal: true` marks a personal topic (family, friends, private
life); nothing from a personal topic ever enters a project store.

### `exemplars/<slug>.<code>.<nn>.md`

```markdown
---
kind: exemplar
topic: software-engineering
language: it
audience: colleagues
source: status email to the team
added: 2026-01-15
words: 180
---
<verbatim excerpt, at most 300 words>
```

Only texts the author wrote without AI. At most five per topic and language.
`nn` is a two-digit sequence number within the topic and language.

### `observations.md` (global and project)

```markdown
---
kind: observations
store: global
last_maintenance: 2026-08-30
---
```

`store` is `global` or `project`. `last_maintenance` appears only in the
global file; maintenance writes it at the end of each run. Each observation is
one `###` section (see Observation entries). The number of `###` sections is
the pending count.

### `.personal-voice/glossary.md`

```markdown
---
kind: glossary
---
## Terms
```

### `.personal-voice/content-types/<slug>.md`

```markdown
---
kind: content-type
content_type: status-report
---
## Conventions
```

Use the slug `general` for conventions that hold for every document in the
project.

## Rule entries

```
- [qualifiers] Rule text in English, quoting "verbatim expressions". (evidence: N, reinforced: YYYY-MM-DD)
```

Qualifiers, in this order, each only when the rule depends on it:

| Qualifier | Form | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Language | `[<code>]` | `[it]` |
| Audience | `[to <audience>]` | `[to clients]`, `[to family]` |
| Topic (tone rules only) | `[topic: <slug>]` | `[topic: cycling]` |

`evidence` is the number of independent texts or sessions that showed the
trait. `reinforced` is the date of the most recent one. Entries in
`languages/<code>.md` always carry that language's qualifier.

Glossary entries use the same form, stating the preferred term, the terms to
avoid and the meaning:

```
- [it] Use "rilascio", not "deploy", for a production release; the client's term. (evidence: 2, reinforced: 2026-09-10)
```

## Observation entries

```markdown
### Avoid "inoltre"
- kind: lexicon
- language: it
- topic: software-engineering
- audience: colleagues
- destination: languages/it.md › Avoid
- evidence: 1
- sources:
  - 2026-09-29 · revision · text: status email to the team · project: example-portal · "Inoltre, il rilascio è pronto." → "E il rilascio è pronto."
```

- **Heading**: the trait in a few English words.
- **kind**: `tone` or `lexicon`.
- **language**: a code, or `any` when the trait holds across languages.
- **topic**: a slug, or `any`.
- **audience**: who the text was for, or `unknown`.
- **destination**: the file and heading routing selects; maintenance writes the
  rule there.
- **sources**: one line per independent text: date, source kind (`revision`,
  `spoken correction` or `own text`), a short label for the text, the project
  as `project: <folder name>` when the text was written in a project, and
  either `"before" → "after"` excerpts or the quoted trait. Give each text a label
  that tells it apart from other texts (what it is, for whom, when). Two lines
  with the same text label count as one piece of evidence.
- **evidence**: the number of distinct text labels in `sources`.
- **reinforces**: only when the trait matches a rule already in the store: the
  rule's file, heading and first words, such as
  `languages/it.md › Avoid › "Inoltre" at the start`. Maintenance then adds
  this evidence to the rule and updates its `reinforced` date, instead of
  proposing a new rule. `destination` is the same file and heading.

A trait that matches a pending observation adds a line to that observation's
`sources`; it never creates a second observation.

## Routing

Answer these questions in order for every observation and rule. The same entry
gets the same destination every time.

0. **Personal?** If it comes from a personal text (a personal topic, or an
   audience such as family or friends), it goes to the global store. Skip
   question 1.
1. **Project?** Would it hold in another project? If not, or if uncertain, it
   goes to the project store: lexicon to `glossary.md`, tone and structure to
   `content-types/<slug>.md`. Stop here.
2. **Tone or lexicon?** Tone is how the text sounds: register, address forms,
   greetings and closings, rhythm, punctuation, structure, LLM habits. Lexicon
   is which words it uses: terms, jargon, expressions, borrowings.
3. **What does it depend on?**

| Kind | Depends on | Destination |
|---|---|---|
| Tone | neither | `core.md` |
| Tone | language | `languages/<code>.md` |
| Tone | topic | `core.md`, or the language file if also language-dependent, with `[topic: <slug>]` |
| Lexicon | topic | `topics/<slug>.md`, with `[<code>]` when it depends on the language |
| Lexicon | language only | `languages/<code>.md` › Signature expressions |
| Lexicon | neither | `core.md` › Expressions (rare: words usually belong to a language) |

Audience never selects a file: it becomes a `[to <audience>]` qualifier.

When the destination is the project store and none exists, the learn skill
offers to create one (see Project store initialization). If the user declined
it in this session, do not record project observations.

### Worked examples

| Case | Answers | Destination |
|---|---|---|
| First observation for a topic with no file | — | `observations.md`, `topic:` set; no topic file until a rule is promoted |
| How the author addresses clients | 2 tone; 3 neither, audience | `core.md` › Audiences, `[to clients]` |
| Terms the author uses in software engineering | 2 lexicon; 3 topic | `topics/software-engineering.md` |
| Writes "deploy", not "rilascio", in Italian software texts | 2 lexicon; 3 topic and language | `topics/software-engineering.md`, `[it]` |
| A literary Italian expression used on several topics | 2 lexicon; 3 language only | `languages/it.md` › Signature expressions |
| Replaces a term with the client's own, in that client's project | 1 no | `.personal-voice/glossary.md` |
| A message to a family member, written inside a project | 0 personal | global store, never `.personal-voice/` |
| Closing informal Italian emails to colleagues | 2 tone; 3 language, audience | `languages/it.md` › Audiences |

The last rule, once promoted, reads:

```
- [it] [to colleagues] Close informal emails with "Un saluto e a presto", never "Cordiali saluti". (evidence: 3, reinforced: 2026-09-12)
```

## Limits

- At most 50 rules per rule file. Maintenance keeps every file at or below it.
- At most five exemplars per topic and language, each at most 300 words.

## Project store initialization

Create `.personal-voice/` only after the user confirms. Outside a git
repository, ask only whether to create it. In a git repository, first explain
the choice in the user's language, covering these points:

> The project store keeps this project's terms and document conventions. It can
> stay personal or be versioned with the project.
>
> - **Personal (default)**: only you see it. It is listed in
>   `.git/info/exclude`, a local file git never shares, so it never shows up in
>   `git status` and never reaches the remote. The project's `.gitignore` is not
>   touched.
> - **Versioned**: it is committed like any other file. Then:
>   - **Readers**: everyone who can read the repository can read it, which
>     includes the whole internet for a public repository.
>   - **History**: once committed, its content stays in the git history even if
>     you delete the folder later.
>   - **Status noise**: every recorded observation shows up as a change in
>     `git status` and in your diffs.
>   - **Merge conflicts**: teammates or branches that record observations at the
>     same time can conflict on the same files.
>   - **Client names**: client terms and names in the glossary become visible to
>     anyone with access, and stay in the history.
>
> Keep it personal, version it, or skip the project store?

Then:

- **Personal**, or a plain yes that names no option: create `.personal-voice/` and append
  the line `.personal-voice/` to the repository's exclude file, creating it if it
  is missing, with the Edit or Write tool rather than a shell command. Claude
  Code protects `.git/`, so this edit asks for permission. The exclude file is
  `.git/info/exclude`; in a linked worktree or submodule, where `.git` is a
  file, get its path from `git rev-parse --git-path info/exclude`.
- **Versioned**: create `.personal-voice/` and touch no ignore file.
- **Skip**: create nothing, record no project observations, and do not ask
  again in this session. A later session may offer it again.
- Never write to `.gitignore` for the project store.
