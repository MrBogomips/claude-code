name: maintain
description: Use when the author asks to review, maintain, clean up or consolidate their personal voice profile, to promote pending voice observations into rules or change a voice rule, when they accept a suggestion to run voice maintenance, or when they want to switch a project's voice store between personal and versioned (for example "share the project glossary with the team").

# Maintain the voice profile

Turn pending observations into rules and keep the stores small, consistent and
current — changing only what the author approves, item by item.

## Hard rules

1. **Start only on request.** Run when the author asks, or accepts a
   suggestion to run maintenance. Never start on your own.
2. **Recap, then stop.** Present the numbered recap and end your turn. Change
   no file until the author names the items to apply. The one write that needs
   no item is the run date at the end of the run.
3. **Vague replies are not authorization.** "ok", "yes", "go ahead", "sounds
   good" → ask for the item numbers, and change nothing.
4. **Personal never goes to a project store**, whatever the author approves.
5. **Re-read before writing.** If a target file changed since the recap, stop
   that item and show it again.

## Stores

- **Global store**: `${user_config.store_dir}`
- **Project store**: `.personal-voice/` at the project root, if it exists
- **Format and routing**: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/shared/store-format.md`. Read
  it first.

If the global store path above is empty or still shows the placeholder text
`user_config.store_dir`, tell the author to set **Voice store directory** in
`/config` and stop.

Use the Glob, Read, Write and Edit tools on store files, not shell commands.

## Workflow

1. **Read** every file of both stores. Note today's date.
2. **Build proposals** with the checks in `references/checks.md`: promotions,
   reinforcements, merges, conflicts, rules that add nothing, stale rules,
   expired observations, size limits, exemplar limits, scope moves.
3. **Recap** exactly as `references/recap.md` describes, then end your turn.
4. **Parse the reply** into explicit item decisions (`references/recap.md`
   §Reading the reply). Echo what will be applied.
5. **Apply** only those items (`references/apply.md`), then record the run
   date and give the final report.

A request to switch the project store between personal and versioned follows
`references/git-choice.md`, inside or outside a maintenance run.

## Red flags

| Thought | Reality |
|---|---|
| "They said ok, so apply everything" | Not item numbers. Ask. |
| "This observation is obviously right; I'll promote it while listing" | Recap first. Every change is an item. |
| "The stale rule is clearly dead" | Flag it. Keep it unless the author approves removal. |
| "The limit is only 51, close enough" | Propose a merge or removal in the same recap. |
| "The family nickname is used everywhere, move it to the project" | Personal material never enters a project store. |
